What is this?
-------------

A personal collection of simple scripts that integrate *everything* with fzf.

They are mostly opinionated, unpolished, unextendable, inconsistent, and
unconfigurable â€” just the way I like them. Only tested on my MacBook.
Keep that in mind.

Hope you find some ideas useful.

How to use
----------

Each script is self-contained and can be run directly and individually.
You can add the repository to your `$PATH`,

```sh
[[ $PATH =~ everything.fzf ]] || PATH="/path/to/everything.fzf:$PATH"
```

or copy/symlink only the ones you like.

Prerequisites
-------------

The scripts are written in Bash and Ruby, so both are required.

Some scripts also depend on the following programs:

* bat
* chrome-cli
* figlet
* gh
* mise
* ripgrep

```sh
brew install bash ruby bat chrome-cli figlet gh mise ripgrep
```
